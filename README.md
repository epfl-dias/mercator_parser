# Mercator Parser

Query parser for Mercator.

## Mercator: Spatial Index

**Mercator** is a spatial *volumetric* index for the [Human Brain Project](http://www.humanbrainproject.eu). It is a component of the [Knowledge Graph](http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/explore-the-brain/search/) service, which  provides the spatial anchoring for the metadata registered as well as processes the volumetric queries.

It is build on top of the Iron Sea database toolkit.

## Iron Sea: Database Toolkit

**Iron Sea** provides a set of database engine bricks, which can be combined and applied on arbitrary data structures.

Unlike a traditional database, it does not assume a specific physical structure for the tables nor the records, but relies on the developper to provide a set of extractor functions which are used by the specific indices provided.

This enables the index implementations to be agnostic from the underlying data structure, and re-used.

## Requirements
